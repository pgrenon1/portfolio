								<em>Hover</em> is a work-in-progress, experimental hardware game with an alternative
								controller made with Arduino. In this one, the players must use communication and
								cooperation to manipulate a aircraft that they need to land on a designated platform.
								The ship has four thrusters that are controlled by four potentiometers.

								<a href="www.emileetmoi.com"><em>Émile et Moi</em></a> is a platformer that uses
								procedural grammar to write poems. The player jumps on platforms that contain a word,
								and the thus chosen word is added to the poem that the player is creating. The words are
								picked from a database of 200 francophone texts of classic Quebecois poets using Markov
								chains. <em>Émile et Moi</em> has <a href="https://twitter.com/EmileEtMoi"> a twitter
									account</a>, and tweets the creations of the players

								<em><a href="https://flopgames.itch.io/lost-signals">Lost Signal</a></em> is a

								one-use item that are held on the faces of the cube. You can only use an item if the
								face that holds it is pointing up. I made a 2D version and a 3D demo.
